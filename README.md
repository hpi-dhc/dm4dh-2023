# Data Management for Digital Health 2023/24

This repository contains the code to reproduce figures, metrics, and models for the 2023/24 version of the [course](https://hpi.de/digital-health-cluster/teaching/winter-term-2023-24/data-management-for-digital-health.html).

To run the code interactively, you can either use:
*  MyBinder (preferred) - click here (and wait for a few seconds): [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hpi-dhc/dm4dh-2023/main)
*  Kaggle (see links below) - click on the links and Click "Copy & Edit" on the Kaggle website

**Note**: If MyBinder is not launching, you can also try to use the Kaggle links below, which should also work without a Kaggle account )open.
